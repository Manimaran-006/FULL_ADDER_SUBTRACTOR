The OR gate is an electronic circuit that gives a high output (1) if one or more of its
inputs are high. A plus (+) is used to show the OR operation. Y= A+B
The NOT gate is an electronic circuit that produces an inverted version of the input at its
output. It is also known as an inverter. If the input variable is A, the inverted output is
known as NOT A. This is also shown as A' or A with a bar over the top, as shown at the
outputs. Y= A'
This is a NOT-AND gate which is equal to an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. The
outputs of all NAND gates are high if any of the inputs are low. The symbol is an AND
gate with a small circle on the output. The small circle represents inversion. Y= (AB)’
This is a NOT-OR gate which is equal to an OR gate followed by a NOT gate. The
outputs of all NOR gates are low if any of the inputs are high. The symbol is an OR gate
with a small circle on the output. The small circle represents inversion. Y= (A+B)’
The 'Exclusive-OR' gate is a circuit which will give a high output if either, but not both of
its two inputs are high. An encircled plus sign (⊕) is used to show the Ex-OR operation.
Y= A⊕B
The 'Exclusive-NOR' gate circuit does the opposite to the EX-OR gate. It will give a low
output if either, but not both of its two inputs are high. The symbol is an EX-OR gate
with a small circle on the output. The small circle represents inversion. Y= A⊕B
1. Type the program in Quartus software.
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Generate the RTL schematic and save the logic diagram.
4. Create nodes for inputs and outputs to generate the timing diagram.
5. For different input combinations generate the timing diagram.
